  Create a function that takes two or more arrays and returns an array of the
  <dfn>
   symmetric difference
  </dfn>
  (
  <code>
   △
  </code>
  or
  <code>
   ⊕

  ) of the provided arrays.

  Given two sets (for example set
  <code>
   A = {1, 2, 3}
  </code>
  and set
  <code>
   B = {2, 3, 4}
  </code>
  ), the mathematical term &#34;symmetric difference&#34; of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the two sets, but not in both (
  <code>
   A △ B = C = {1, 4}
  </code>
  ). For every additional symmetric difference you take (say on a set
  <code>
   D = {2, 3}
  </code>
  ), you should get the set with elements which are in either of the two the sets but not both (
  <code>
   C △ D = {1, 4} △ {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3, 4}
  </code>
  ).
