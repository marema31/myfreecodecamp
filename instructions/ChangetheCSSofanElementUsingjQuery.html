  We can also change the CSS of an HTML element directly with jQuery.
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  jQuery has a function called
  <code>
   .css()
  </code>
  that allows you to change the CSS of an element.
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  Here&#39;s how we would change its color to blue:
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  <code>
   $(&#34;#target1&#34;).css(&#34;color&#34;, &#34;blue&#34;);
  </code>
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  This is slightly different from a normal CSS declaration, because the CSS property and its value are in quotes, and separated with a comma instead of a colon.
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  Delete your jQuery selectors, leaving an empty
  <code>
   document ready function
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  Select
  <code>
   target1
  </code>
  and change its color to red.
