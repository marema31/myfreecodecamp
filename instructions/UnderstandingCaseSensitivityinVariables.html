  In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  <code>
   MYVAR
  </code>
  is not the same as
  <code>
   MyVar
  </code>
  nor
  <code>
   myvar
  </code>
  . It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you
  <em>
   do not
  </em>
  use this language feature.

 <h4>
  Best Practice
 </h4>
 <p class="wrappable">
  Write variable names in Javascript in
  <dfn>
   camelCase
  </dfn>
  . In
  <dfn>
   camelCase
  </dfn>
  , multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.
 </p>

  <strong>
   Examples:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  var someVariable;
  <br>
  var anotherVariableName;
  <br>
  var thisVariableNameIsTooLong;
 </blockquote>
 <h4>
  Instructions
 </h4>
 <p class="wrappable">
  Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use
  <dfn>
   camelCase
  </dfn>
  .
  <br>
  Do not create any new variables.
