  Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  Using
  <code>
   //
  </code>
  will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  // This is an in-line comment.
 </blockquote>
 <p class="wrappable">
  You can make a multi-line comment beginning with
  <code>
   /*
  </code>
  and ending with
  <code>
   */
  </code>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  /* This is a
  <br>
  multi-line comment */
 </blockquote>
 <p class="wrappable">
  <strong>
   Best Practice
  </strong>
  <br>
  As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others
  <em>
   and
  </em>
  for your future self.
