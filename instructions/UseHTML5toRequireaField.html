  You can require specific form fields so that your user will not be able to submit your form until he or she has filled them out.
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  For example, if you wanted to make a text input field required, you can just add the word
  <code>
   required
  </code>
  within your
  <code>
   input
  </code>
  element, you would use:
  <code>
   &lt;input type=&#34;text&#34; required&gt;
  </code>
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  Make your text
  <code>
   input
  </code>
  a
  <code>
   required
  </code>
  field, so that your user can&#39;t submit the form without completing this field.
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  Then try to submit the form without inputing any text. See how your HTML5 form notifies you that the field is required?
 </p>

  Note: This field does not work in Safari.
