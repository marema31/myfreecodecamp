  Now we&#39;re ready to learn jQuery, the most popular JavaScript tool of all time. Don&#39;t worry about JavaScript itself - we will cover it soon.
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  Before we can start using jQuery, we need to add some things to our HTML.
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  First, add a
  <code>
   script
  </code>
  element at the top of your page. Be sure to close it on the following line.
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  Your browser will run any JavaScript inside a
  <code>
   script
  </code>
  element, including jQuery.
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  Inside your
  <code>
   script
  </code>
  element, add this code:
  <code>
   $(document).ready(function() {
  </code>
  to your
  <code>
   script
  </code>
  . Then close it on the following line (still inside your
  <code>
   script
  </code>
  element) with:
  <code>
   });
  </code>
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  We&#39;ll learn more about
  <code>
   functions
  </code>
  later. The important thing to know is that code you put inside this
  <code>
   function
  </code>
  will run as soon as your browser has loaded your page.
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  This is important because without your
  <code>
   document ready function
  </code>
  , your code may run before your HTML is rendered, which would cause bugs.
