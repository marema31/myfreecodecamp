  You&#39;ve seen why id attributes are so convenient for targeting with jQuery selectors. But you won&#39;t always have such neat ids to work with.
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  Fortunately, jQuery has some other tricks for targeting the right elements.
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  jQuery uses CSS Selectors to target elements.
  <code>
   target:nth-child(n)
  </code>
  css selector allows you to select all the nth elements with the target class or element type.

  Here&#39;s how you would give the third element in each well the bounce class:
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  <code>
   $(&#34;.target:nth-child(3)&#34;).addClass(&#34;animated bounce&#34;);
  </code>
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  Make the second child in each of your well elements bounce. You must target the children of element with the
  <code>
   target
  </code>
  class.
