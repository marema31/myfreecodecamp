  In the HTML5 and CSS section of FreeCodeCamp we built a Cat Photo App. Now let&#39;s go back to it. This time, we&#39;ll style it using the popular Bootstrap responsive CSS framework.
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name
  <code>
   Responsive Design
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. It will look good on devices with screens of any width.
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  <code>
   &lt;link rel=&#34;stylesheet&#34; href=&#34;//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css&#34;/&gt;
  </code>
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  In this case, we&#39;ve already added it for you to this page behind the scenes.
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  To get started, we should nest all of our HTML in a
  <code>
   div
  </code>
  element with the class
  <code>
   container-fluid
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <div class="negative-bottom-margin-30">
 </div>
</div>
