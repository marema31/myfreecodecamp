  Web developers traditionally use
  <code>
   lorem ipsum text
  </code>
  as placeholder text. The &#39;lorem ipsum&#39; text is randomly scraped from a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome.

 <p class="wrappable">
  Lorem ipsum text has been used as placeholder text by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web.

  Well, 5 centuries is long enough. Since we&#39;re building a CatPhotoApp, let&#39;s use something called
  <code>
   kitty ipsum text
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p class="wrappable">
  Replace the text inside your
  <code>
   p
  </code>
  element with the first few words of this kitty ipsum text:
  <code>
   Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.
